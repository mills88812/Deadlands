# Some guidelines to follow when contributing code:

## before we start
[consult your goals with someone? it's better if other people know what you are doing and if it's in line with the other things]

- `git checkout main` 
- `git pull`
- `git checkout -b BRANCHNAME` (replace BRANCHNAME with your own feature, eg. water_system, better_gliding, ...)

if you need help with this, let me (Tamkish) know.

## while coding
- try to follow best practices if you can. these are just guidelines and don't need to be taken *that seriously* (for example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_best_practices#Coding_standards)
  - don't over-abbreviate your variables. it is better to have longer names than confusing ones?
  - comment. if you think you should explain ***why*** youre doing something, write it in a comment.

## after finishing
 - **build your game and include the .dll file in the commit** (some folks here are doing the levels and cannot compile the code)
 - make a pull request in github
 - let at least one person look at it

 if you have any problems/questions with git, let me know (Tamkish). hopefully i'll be able to help
